          consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
          with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
          parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
          provided with a SChool canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
          and
          dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate
          all the fuss of money handling. making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
